# StuRentHub
Developed a dynamic web application that serves as a platform for students to rent and lend essential items such as books, electronics, furniture, and more. The system facilitates secure user registration, item listing, and rental transactions through an intuitive interface. Integrated features include a search and filter mechanism, payment gateway for secure transactions, and a notification system for rental updates. The project promotes affordability and sustainability by encouraging resource sharing among students, reducing waste, and fostering a collaborative community.
